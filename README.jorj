The serial line is 9600 baud - but the speed of the transfer will be
limited by the I2C bus. This code uses the slowest possible read and
write operations, as they're the simplest to implement and the most
likely to work on the widest variety of devices. So programming a
256Kb (32KB) 24LC256 takes about 6 minutes, 16 seconds.
